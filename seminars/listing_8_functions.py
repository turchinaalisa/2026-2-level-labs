# Common information about functions
#
# functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task
# functions are defined using the `def`` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses
# arguments can be passed to functions within the parentheses
# functions can return data as a result using the return statement


# Create a function, that doesn't return anything
def print_hello_world() -> None:
    """
    Prints a string "Hello world!".

    Returns:

# Built-in functions:
#
# print() -> prints the value into console
# max() -> finds the maximum element in an array
# min() -> finds the minimum element in an array
# dict() -> creates dictionary
# str() -> casts the value to a string
# list() -> creates an empty list or converts value to a list
# type() -> returns type of the value
# etc.
