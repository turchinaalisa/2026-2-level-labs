# Common information about strings
#
# strings are immutable
# strings are iterable
# strings are case-sensitive

# Create a string
example_str = "Hello"  # or "Hello"
print(example_str)

# .format() method

# Common information about loops
#
# loops allow repeating a block of code multiple times
# two main types of loops in Python: for and while
# loops can be nested, and can include break, continue, and else blocks

# for loop over iterable
example = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for item in example:
    print(item)  # prints each item in the list

# while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# break and continue
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break  # exit the loop
    if i == 1:
        continue  # skip this iteration
    print(i)

# for / else
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
    if i == 5:
        break
else:
    print("Loop completed without break")


# Common information about lists
#
# lists are mutable
# lists are iterable

# Create a list
example_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(example_list)

# List concatenation, the original list doesn't change
first_list = example_list + [2, 3, 4]
print(example_list)
print(first_list)

# List changes
example_list.append(2)
example_list.extend([2, 3, 4])
print(example_list)

# List copy
first_test = [1, 2, 3, [1, 2, 3]]
test_copy = first_test.copy()
print(first_test, test_copy)
test_copy[3].append(4)
print(first_test, test_copy)

first_test = [1, 2, 3, [1, 2, 3]]
test_deepcopy = copy.deepcopy(first_test)
test_deepcopy[3].append(4)
print(first_test, test_deepcopy)

# List methods
# .insert(index, item) - inserts the given item on the mentioned index
# .remove(item) - removes the first occurrence of the given item from the list
# .pop() or .pop(index) – removes the item from the given index
# (or the last item) and returns that item
# .index(item) – returns the index of the first occurrence
# .sort() – sorts the list in place i.e modifies the original list
# .reverse() – reverses the list in place
# .copy() – returns a shallow copy of the list


# Common information about tuples
#
# tuples are typically defined using parentheses, with elements separated by commas
# tuples are immutable, i.e. their elements cannot be changed after creation
# tuples can contain items of different data types
# tuples support indexing and slicing, but do not support item assignment

# Create a tuple
example_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(example_tuple)

# Tuple concatenation: the original tuple doesn't change, and a new tuple is created
first_tuple = example_tuple + (2, 3, 4)
print(example_tuple)
print(first_tuple)

# "Modifying" a tuple requires creating a new one
modified_tuple = example_tuple + (9,)
print(modified_tuple)

# Tuple methods
# .count(item) – returns the number of occurrences of the item
# .index(item) – returns the index of the first occurrence of the item
